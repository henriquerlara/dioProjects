# Unit Tests Project

This repository contains a **Unit Tests Project** developed in C# using **.NET** and **xUnit**. The project aims to implement unit tests for critical functionalities, ensuring code quality and reliability while demonstrating best practices for testing.

## Features

- **ValidationsConsole**:
  - Implements core functionality for list and string validations.
  - Example methods include:
    - **RemoveNegativeNumbers**: Filters negative numbers from a list.
    - **ContainsCharacter**: Checks if a specific character exists in a string.

- **ValidationsTests**:
  - Includes unit tests to validate the behavior of methods in `ValidationsConsole`.
  - Covers both positive and negative scenarios to ensure comprehensive testing.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to highlight the importance of unit testing in software development. By identifying potential issues early in the development process, the project ensures code quality, reliability, and maintainability. This approach not only reduces the likelihood of bugs but also increases developer confidence in the functionality of the application.
