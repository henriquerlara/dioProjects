# Hotel Booking System

## Description

This project is a simple **Hotel Booking System** built in C#. It allows users to manage hotel suite reservations by registering guests, assigning suites, and calculating the total booking cost. The system also includes functionality to display reservation details and apply discounts for extended stays.

## Features

- **Register Guests**: Add guests to a reservation by entering their names. The system checks that the number of guests does not exceed the suite's capacity.
- **Register Suite**: Assign a suite to a reservation by specifying its type, capacity, and daily rate.
- **Calculate Total Cost**: Calculate the total cost for a reservation based on the number of days booked. A 10% discount is automatically applied for reservations longer than 10 days.
- **View Reservation Summary**: Display a summary of the reservation, including the total number of guests and the calculated booking cost.
