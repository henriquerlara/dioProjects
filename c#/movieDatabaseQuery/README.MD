# Movie Database Query Project

## Description

This project focuses on querying a **Movie Database** to extract meaningful insights for analysis. The database is modeled with five primary tables: **Movies**, **Actors**, **Genres**, **MovieCast**, and **MoviesGenres**. The SQL queries provided aim to demonstrate the use of filtering, table joins, grouping, and ordering to answer specific questions about the data.

## Database Structure

The database includes the following tables:

1. **Movies**: Contains information about movies, including their name, release year, and duration.
2. **Actors**: Stores details about actors, such as their first name, last name, and gender.
3. **Genres**: Lists the names of different movie genres.
4. **MovieCast**: Represents a many-to-many relationship between movies and actors, including the roles actors play in each movie.
5. **MoviesGenres**: Represents a many-to-many relationship between movies and genres.

## Objectives

The main objective is to execute **12 SQL queries** to retrieve specific data from the database.

## Project Files

This project includes two SQL files:

1. **DDL_and_DML.sql**: Contains the **Data Definition Language (DDL)** statements to create the database and tables, as well as **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** statements to insert the initial data into the tables.
2. **DQL.sql**: Contains **Data Query Language (DQL)** statements to perform the **12 queries** required to extract specific information from the database.
