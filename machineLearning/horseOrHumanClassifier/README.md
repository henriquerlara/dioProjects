# ðŸ§  Transfer Learning for Binary Image Classification

This project implements **Transfer Learning** to classify images into two categories using a pre-trained model. The dataset used is **"Horse or Human"**, which is downloaded automatically within the notebook.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
- **Dataset**: The dataset consists of images of horses and humans, used to train a binary classifier.
- **Model**: A pre-trained **VGG16** model is used as a feature extractor, with custom classification layers added.
- **Training**: The model is fine-tuned on the new dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy and loss are analyzed for both training and validation sets.

## âš¡ Environment
- This project was developed using a **virtual environment (`venv`)** to manage dependencies.
